# System-Software-Compiler-Design-CS1014-
Programs for Compiler Design Laboratory

## Points to remember :
<ul>
<li> Python is required to be installed in your system (2.7.12 or 3.6.1).
<li> I recommend using PyCharm IDE for Python programming purposes. The IDE is sleek and it's easy to debug your code.
<li> The programs in this repo are for understanding purposes only. 
<li> It is highly recommended that the student understands the code and then implements it -- not merely copy paste it.
<li> Some programs are sensitive to the format of the input. Please check the Sample IO file under every lab folder to get an idea of the input format.
<li> Some programs might not work for the inputs that you are giving. In that case, feel free to debug.
</ul>
